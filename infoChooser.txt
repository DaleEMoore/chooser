Overview
I want it to prompt the user for a number between 1 and 10.
There will be two "correct" numbers (let's say 3 and 7) and if you enter them, the program will congratulate you.
If not, it will tell you to try again.
If we get this working, we could get more interesting and have the correct numbers randomly generate when the program
starts so it's never the same two twice, then maybe give the user a limited number of guesses.


TODOs
Set correct numbers 3 and 7.
Ask user, what number am I thinking of.
If it's 3 or 7, congratulate them.
Let them try again.
